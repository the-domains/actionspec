It requires you to devote your whole self to being an expert in your vertical. By way of comparison, Technology is also a whole-self pursuit. We manage your technology from end to end, so you can worry about the things that matter.</p><h2>Highly Experienced</h2><p>ActionSpec has operated in the small business space since its inception in 2014. This experience in small business has given us the edge in the marketplace over our much larger institutionalized rivals. Our staff members have no fewer than 15 years of experience working in all aspects of the IT space, which give us a unique, well rounded insight into the challenges of small businesses and startups.</p><h2>Attention to Detail</h2><p>There is a snowflake variety of IT companies out there, but the bigger they are, the more they lose focus on the small things and challenges that small businesses have to worry about. We obsess on the details that make your operation run, and it shows. Small issues can become huge problems, so we make sure that your digital footprint is ready to take on the big challenge of growth.</p><h2>Piece of Mind</h2><p>There are so many things that can happen from day to day. We enable our clients to focus on their core business, because not everybody is an IT, Web or Cloud expert. You have enough to think about when you are out there selling. If something goes wrong, we are there to fix it. Our response time to IT related issues is within minutes, not hours or days like our larger counterparts. If something goes horribly wrong, we will make it right. We stand by our work!</p><h2>Our History</h2><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f0cc598d-5436-42ff-b3b6-0b823fd6fd07.jpg"><p>ActionSpec, LLC started in 2014. Rick Conlee, our Founding President, has worked in all aspects of the IT world. From his humble beginnings as an IT intern for an international airport, to an ambitious entrepreneur – Rick has over 15 years of IT experience, of which 7 of those have been running IT companies – which gives him insight into startup culture and the unique challenges presented. ActionSpec was founded on the philosophy that small companies and startups need a single point of contact for all their digital needs. At the time ActionSpec was founded, there was no firm that truly specialized in the “Big 3.” The “Big 3” are Web, Cloud and IT Support. Having a single point of contact for all the IT needs of small business enables a growing company to minimize the number of vendors they need to interact with, especially when that litany of vendors all deal in complicated business critical interactions. ActionSpec was founded to simplify that, without sacrificing quality of service.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="28"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="30"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="31"><span data-reactid="32"><!-- react-empty: 33 --><h2 data-reactid="34"><a data-reactid="35">ActionSpec, LLC</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="36"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="37"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="38"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="39"></div></section></div></div>

From his humble beginnings as an IT intern for an international airport, to an ambitious entrepreneur – Rick has over 15 years of IT experience, of which 7 of those have been running IT companies – which gives him insight into startup culture and the unique challenges presented. ActionSpec was founded on the philosophy that small companies and startups need a single point of contact for all their digital needs. At the time ActionSpec was founded, there was no firm that truly specialized in the “Big 3.” The “Big 3” are Web, Cloud and IT Support. Having a single point of contact for all the IT needs of small business enables a growing company to minimize the number of vendors they need to interact with, especially when that litany of vendors all deal in complicated business critical interactions. ActionSpec was founded to simplify that, without sacrificing quality of service."}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":3,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"ActionSpec
